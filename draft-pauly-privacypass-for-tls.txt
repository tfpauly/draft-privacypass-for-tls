            Including Privacy Pass Tokens in TLS Handshakes
                 draft-pauly-privacypass-for-tls-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism for TLS servers to request, and TLS
   clients to provide, Privacy Pass tokens as part of the Encrypted
   Client Hello in the TLS handshake.  This creates a way to add support
   for anonymous attestation and rate-limiting to servers that are
   enforcing denial-of-service protections as part of processing TLS
   handshakes.

1.  Introduction

   Privacy Pass Tokens [PPARCH] are cryptographic authentication
   messages that can be used to verify properties of a network entity,
   such as proving that a client passed some attestation check, without
   being linkable to other tokens or revealing identities.

   [PPAUTH] defines how Privacy Pass Tokens can be requested by HTTP
   servers (via an authentication challenge) and provided by HTTP
   clients.  This is useful for providing privacy-preserving
   authentication or attestation in HTTP workflows.  However, Privacy
   Pass Tokens can also be used in other contexts and protocols.  For
   example, [I-D.sawant-eap-ppt] defines how to include tokens in EAP
   (Extensible Authentication Protocol) exchanges.

   Some server deployments enforce rate-limiting on TLS [TLS13]
   handshakes to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, particularly
   by rate limiting the number of connections allowed from individual
   client IP addresses or IP address subnets.  This is common in
   scenarios where the cost of handling a terminated TLS connection is
   significantly higher than handling the initial handshake, like in L7
   loadbalancers with heavy-weight protocol conversions after
   termination.

   This enforcement can particularly impact cases where many clients are
   using a particular IP subnet due to using a privacy-preserving proxy
   (some examples are described in [PRIVACYPARTITIONING]).  For such
   cases, even if clients are able to provide Privacy Pass Tokens or
   similar proofs at the HTTP layer, their connections might be denied
   or rate-limiting during TLS session establishment.

   In order to signal that clients meet certain criteria (rate-limiting,
   etc), without disclosing individual client identities or pseudonyms,
   this document defines a way to include Privacy Pass Tokens within the
   TLS handshake.  Specifically, these tokens are sent within the TLS
   Encrypted Client Hello [ECH].  This prevents network observers from
   being able to directly observe the tokens, while still allowing the
   TLS server to observe the token early in the handshake.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview

   Clients can include Privacy Pass tokens as part of the TLS Client
   Hello via the privacy_pass_token extension.  This is described in
   Section 5.  Clients MAY be configured to always present tokens when
   performing a TLS handshake with a particular server.  However, in
   general, clients SHOULD NOT automatically include Privacy Pass
   tokens; without an explicit challenge, clients won't know the
   relevant token type or issuer to use.

   Servers can request tokens by adding the privacy_pass_challenge
   extension to a TLS Hello Retry Request.  This is described in
   Section 4.  Servers that want to receive Privacy Pass tokens as a way
   to enforce DoS protection SHOULD send challenges to clients when
   these clients would otherwise be blocked or rate-limited in some
   fashion.

4.  Requesting Privacy Pass Tokens

   In order to request that a client sends a Privacy Pass token, a
   server can send a Hello Retry Request ([TLS13], Section 4.1.4) that
   includes a privacy_pass_challenge extension.

   The privacy_pass_challenge extension has the following format:

         struct {
             opaque challenge<1..2^16-1>;
             opaque token_key<0..2^16-1>;
         } PrivacyPassChallenge;

   The fields are defined as follows:

   *  challenge contains a TokenChallenge structure, as defined in
      [PPAUTH], Section 2.1.1.

   *  token_key contains a public key for use with the issuance
      protocol, where applicable.  This is equivalent to the token-key
      parameter used in HTTP authentication challenges discussed in
      [PPAUTH], Section 2.1.1.  The token_key may be empty (have a zero
      length), in which case clients are expected to fetch the token key
      for a particular issuer name in another way.

   If a client does not include the token in the Client Hello (or
   subsequent Client Hello after being challenged), the server MAY
   reject the request or apply rate-limiting.

   Clients SHOULD apply some form of consistency check on the token
   challenge to avoid (malicious) anonymity set partitioning by the
   server; see Section 6.2 of [PPARCH] for more details.

   Servers sending challenges can use a non-empty redemption_context in
   order to bind the token challenge to a particular context (such as
   the client IP address, or a time window) to aid in token replay
   prevention.  Servers MAY combine sending privacy_pass_challenge
   extensions with a cookie extension ([TLS13], Section 4.2.2).  For
   example, servers that cannot statefully persist the token challenge
   presented to the client in the privacy_pass_challenge extension can
   use the cookie extension to encode this challenge.

5.  Presenting Privacy Pass Tokens in Encrypted Client Hello

   Clients can include Privacy Pass tokens in TLS handshakes using the
   privacy_pass_token extension.  This extension MUST be sent in the
   Inner Client Hello, using [ECH].  If ECH is not supported, clients
   SHOULD NOT use Privacy Pass tokens in TLS in order to avoid adding
   more tracking entropy visible on the wire, and making it easier to
   trivially replay tokens to a server.

   The privacy_pass_token extension has the following format:

         struct {
             opaque token<1..2^16-1>;
         } PrivacyPassToken;

   The token field uses the Token structure defined in [PPAUTH],
   Section 2.1.1.

6.  Applicable Token Types

   This document is defined such that any Privacy Pass token type would
   be possible to use in the TLS handshake.  However, different token
   types will have different properties for latency, replay protection,
   and privacy.

   Ideally, deployments can use token types that allow for unique
   redemption contexts (to prevent replay attacks) that also do not
   require communicating with a token attester or issuer for each token
   creation (thus improving latency, and not creating new activity that
   can be used to fingerprint clients).  Some proposed token types like
   [ARC] and [BBS] have these properties.

7.  Security Considerations

   Servers redeeming Privacy Pass tokens in TLS handshakes need to take
   care to avoid replay attacks.  Using a fresh redemption context in
   the challenge ensures that tokens are equally fresh and unique.

   As discussed in Section 6, token issuance types that don't require
   clients talking to an issuance server with a new network request for
   every token generation will have better properties for privacy, since
   the client won't make a new request after each TLS handshake
   challenge.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Update of the TLS ExtensionType Registry

   IANA is requested to create the following entries in the existing
   registry for ExtensionType (defined in [TLS13]):

   1.  privacy_pass_challenge(0xfd00), with the "TLS 1.3" column values
       set to "HRR", "DTLS-Only" column set to "N", "Recommended" column
       set to "Yes".

   2.  privacy_pass_token(TBD), with "TLS 1.3" column values set to
       "CH", "DTLS-Only" column set to "N", and "Recommended" column set
       to "Yes", and the "Comment" column set to "Only appears in inner
       CH."
