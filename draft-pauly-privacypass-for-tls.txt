            Including Privacy Pass Tokens in TLS Handshakes
                 draft-pauly-privacypass-for-tls-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism for TLS servers to request, and TLS
   clients to provide, Privacy Pass tokens as part of the Encrypted
   Client Hello in the TLS handshake.  This is a way to add support for
   anonymous attestation and rate-limiting to servers that are enforcing
   denial-of-service protections as part of processing TLS handshakes.

1.  Introduction

   Privacy Pass Tokens [PPARCH] are cryptographic authentication
   messages that can be used to verify properties of a network entity,
   such as proving that a client passed some attestation check, without
   being linkable to other tokens or revealing identities.

   [PPAUTH] defines how Privacy Pass Tokens can be requested by HTTP
   servers (via an authentication challenge) and provided by HTTP
   clients.  This is useful for providing privacy-preserving
   authentication or attestation in HTTP workflows.  However, Privacy
   Pass Tokens can also be used in other contexts and protocols.  For
   example, [I-D.sawant-eap-ppt] defines how to include tokens in EAP
   (Extensible Authentication Protocol) exchanges.

   Some server deployments enforce rate-limiting on TLS [TLS] handshakes
   to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, particularly by rate
   limiting the number of connections allowed from individual client IP
   addresses or IP address subnets.  This can particularly impact cases
   where many clients are using a particular IP subnet due to using a
   privacy-preserving proxy (some examples are described in
   [PRIVACYPARTITIONING]).  For such cases, even if clients are able to
   provide Privacy Pass Tokens or similar proofs at the HTTP layer,
   their connections might be denied or rate-limiting during TLS session
   establishment.

   In order to provide an extra signal that clients are authentic and
   meet certain criteria (rate-limiting, etc), without disclosing
   individual client identities or pseudonyms, this document defines a
   way to include Privacy Pass Tokens within the TLS handshake.
   Specifically, these tokens are sent within the TLS Encrypted Client
   Hello [ECH] to prevent network observers from being able to directly
   observe the tokens.
